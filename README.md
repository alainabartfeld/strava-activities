# strava-activities
This repo has a one-time script to get access keys for a given Strava account using environment variables. Then it downloads the data as a CSV file and deposits it into the `./data` folder, and writes logs to the `./logs` folder on runtime.

It answers similar questions to Strava's Year in Sport, with additional insights enabled from what data is accessible via the API.
